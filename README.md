Project Title: Full-Stack E-Commerce Web Application
Tech Stack: React, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Tailwind CSS

Project Summary:
This project is a complete online shopping platform that I developed using the MERN stack. It allows users to register, verify their email via OTP, log in, browse products, manage a cart, place orders, and track their deliveries. The system also supports features like wishlists, user dashboards, and different user roles (like buyer and seller), providing a personalized and secure shopping experience.

**Frontend Highlights (React):
Built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS for a responsive and modern UI.

Includes OTP-based email verification, secure login/logout, cart and wishlist management.

Users can track orders, view order history, and interact with a dashboard showing recent activities.

**Backend Highlights (Node.js/Express):
RESTful API built with Express, connected to a MongoDB database via Mongoose.

Secure JWT-based authentication and bcrypt password hashing.

Integrated Nodemailer to send OTPs for email verification.

Used Multer for image upload functionality during product listing.

Modular and scalable code with middleware for CORS, body parsing, and more.

**Objective:**
The goal was to create a scalable, user-friendly, and secure e-commerce system that covers the entire customer journey â€” from account creation to product browsing, payment, and order tracking.

**Outcome:**
This project helped me strengthen my skills in full-stack development, understand real-world application design, and manage critical features like authentication, file handling, and database management. It reflects my ability to build robust, user-focused applications using modern web technologies.
